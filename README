Solution to the 'AC duct problem'
================================

Instructions:
============
Written and tested on Linux machines. :)

Written in C with no dependencies.
Just run make, and run the executable 'duct'.

Usage:
./duct < <grid file>

The grid file describes the grid as follows:

A list of integers separated by whitespace.
The first two are the width and height in that order.
And then a width*height integers that describe the grid as follows:

0 - Rooms owned by us
1 - Rooms not owned by us
2 - Start room
3 - End room

Comment:
========

This solution ran just under one minute for the input you
gave on your website, On a 2.4 GHz machine in my university.

Please tell me what you think.
